## Projects

Here are a few highlights of my projects:

- [Project 1] Sales forecasting: # Sales Forecasting Application

Welcome to my Sales Forecasting Application repository. This project is developed using Angular and Flask, combining the power of frontend and backend technologies to provide accurate sales predictions.

## About the Project

The Sales Forecasting Application is designed to help businesses make informed decisions by predicting future sales trends based on historical data. Leveraging the Angular framework for the frontend and Flask, a Python-based web framework, for the backend, this application offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization:** The application presents sales data in interactive charts and graphs, allowing users to visually analyze historical sales patterns.

- **Machine Learning Models:** By integrating machine learning algorithms, the application predicts future sales based on historical data, enabling businesses to make proactive decisions.

- **User Authentication:** The application includes user authentication functionality, ensuring secure access to sensitive sales data and forecasts.

- **Data Import and Export:** Users can import historical sales data from various sources and export forecasted sales data for further analysis or integration with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** Angular is a popular frontend framework that enables the development of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Flask:** Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework written in Python, is used for the backend development. It provides efficient routing, database integration, and REST API capabilities.

- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Python libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow are utilized for implementing machine learning models to forecast sales.
